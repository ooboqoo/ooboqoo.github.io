> Use webpack for apps, and Rollup for libraries.


## Introduction

you can use Rollup to compile to UMD or CommonJS format, and then point to that compiled version with the `main` property in your `package.json` file. If your `package.json` file also has a `module` field, ES6-aware tools like Rollup and webpack 2 will import the ES6 module version directly.
