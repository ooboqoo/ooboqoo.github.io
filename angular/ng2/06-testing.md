# Testing

The QuickStart documentation doesn't discuss testing.
This repo adds both karma/jasmine unit test and protractor end-to-end testing support.

These tools are configured for specific conventions described below.

*It is unwise and rarely possible to run the application, the unit tests, and the e2e tests at the same time.
We recommend that you shut down one before starting another.*

## Unit Tests
TypeScript unit-tests are usually in the `app` folder. Their filenames must end in `.spec`.

Look for the example `app/app.component.spec.ts`.
Add more `.spec.ts` files as you wish; we configured karma to find them.

Run it with `npm test`

That command first compiles the application, then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the karma test-runner.
Both the compiler and the karma watch for (different) file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

Test-runner output appears in the terminal window.
We can update our app and our tests in real-time, keeping a weather eye on the console for broken tests.
Karma is occasionally confused and it is often necessary to shut down its browser or even shut the command down (Ctrl-C) and
restart it. No worries; it's pretty quick.

The `HTML-Reporter` is also wired in. That produces a prettier output; look for it in `~_test-output/tests.html`.

## End-to-end (E2E) Tests

E2E tests are in the `e2e` directory, side by side with the `app` folder.
Their filenames must end in `.e2e-spec.ts`.

Look for the example `e2e/app.e2e-spec.ts`.
Add more `.e2e-spec.js` files as you wish (although one usually suffices for small projects);
we configured protractor to find them.

Thereafter, run them with `npm run e2e`.

That command first compiles, then simultaneously starts the Http-Server at `localhost:8080`
and launches protractor.  

The pass/fail test results appear at the bottom of the terminal window.
A custom reporter (see `protractor.config.js`) generates a  `./_test-output/protractor-results.txt` file
which is easier to read; this file is excluded from source control.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.
